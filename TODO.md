  ## Feature list
  * denotes on my to do for the project
  2.5 days = 20 hours

  ### difficulty scale 1-10. 1 meaning it's already finished 10 meaning what?!?!

  5 = 3 hours
  7 = 5 hours
  10 = full day + ??

  Concept: A grocery list allowing the user to add items. Create check boxes to delete items that have been bought then update the list.
  Possibly produce a chart showing which items you buy the most of.

  (5) add due date
  *(7) time stamps (moment.js)
  *(5) format the display of the items in a list (need to add more detail)
  *(??) fix the layout
  *(8)ability to select and delete multiple items (checkbox?)
  (7)ability to add/leave comments on item
  *(5)delete item confirmation
  (5)Panic Button
  (6)pagination (if more than 10 show a next button)
  (5)category pages (not really pages, just a show/hide trick)
  (7)add more items button, that shows another input section allowing for multiple items to be added at once
  (8)Fun stuff
